# Mode-Qoute-Searching-APP
Side Project in EECS
This is a mobile application about the mode quotes searching, which developed in Python. The main technique and library I used is Kivy. The mobile platform I used is Android, and I also had already packaged it and installed on my own phone. This is a good project to practice to program on mobile platform.
